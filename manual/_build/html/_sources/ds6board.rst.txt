creating the DS_D6 board 
========================


the DS_D6 board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note:** the board is the smart watch


After adapting an existing board, why not create your own?


.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/boards/arm (nordic nrf52832 is an arm processor) 

::
    
    this directory contains all the arm boards,  you could copy one, and rename all the references. 




    In this github repo, an example ds_d6 directory is provided. 
    Put it under ..../boards/arm.
    Should be usable afterwards.





``the DS6 watch does not contain an external crystal to generate 32Khz, so we need to adapt the config``

.. code-block:: console


    $ vi ds_d6_defconfig 


verify if this line is contained :
**CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_K32SRC_SYNTH=y**

**and finally build your board (ds_d6)**



.. code-block:: console

      west build -p -b ds_d6 samples/bluetooth/eddystone/
