Generating a new keypair
------------------------
Generating a keypair with imgtool is a matter of running the keygen
subcommand:

.. code-block:: console


    $ ./scripts/imgtool.py keygen -k mykey.pem -t rsa-2048



Extracting the public key
-------------------------

The generated keypair above contains both the public and the private
key.  It is necessary to extract the public key and insert it into the
bootloader.  

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./scripts/imgtool.py getpub -k mykey.pem

This will output the public key as a C array that can be dropped
directly into the `keys.c` file.
