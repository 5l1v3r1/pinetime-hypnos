Bosch BMA280
############


.. code-block:: console

      west build -p -b pinetime samples/drivers/bma280 




Overview
********

This sample application mimics the presence of a bosch, bma280 accel sensor.
For this sensor exists a driver in zephyr, but no sample.
Remember, I'm not a zephyr expert and am learning on the way.




Requirements
************

complement the pinetime.dts file with the following (under samples/sensor/bma280) 

.. code-block:: console

     &i2c1 {
             bma280@18 {
                 	compatible = "bosch,bma280"; 
     	        	reg = <0x18>;
     	 	        label = "BMA280";
     		        int1-gpios = <&gpio0 8 0>;
     	               };
            };
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Create a file: `/dts/bindings/sensor/bosch,bma280-i2c.yaml`.
Which contains:

::

     compatible: "bosch,bma280"
     include: i2c-device.yaml
     properties:
            int1-gpios:
            type: phandle-array
            required: false



Building and Running
********************


Todo
****

    - since no serial port and no J-LINK, I have to print messages to the screen or trough bluetooth serial (which does not exist, or I haven't found it yet ;) )
