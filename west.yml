# The west manifest file for the Pinetime.
#
# The per-installation west configuration file specifies the location of this
# manifest file. The "path" option in the [manifest] section of .west/config
# defines the folder that contains west.yml. The path is relative to the folder
# that contains .west.
#
# You can create your own manifest files and put them in any
# repository you want, to create your own custom Pinetime installation.
# For example, you could create a manifest file in your own
# out-of-tree application directory, which would pull the pinetime repository
# in as an ordinary project.
#
# You can pass your manifest repositories to west init when creating a
# new pinetime installation. See the west documentation for more
# information.
